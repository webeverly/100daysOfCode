# 100 Days Of Code

Asked ChatGPT to build a 100 days of code plan to challenge myself.

Here's what's got out of it ⬇️ 

---
* 1-3 : HTML / CSS
* 4-6 : JS (var, function, loops, conditions, this)
* 7-10 : PHP exercises (might replace it with Python)
---
* 11-30 : React
* 31-50 : Vue.js
* 51-75 : Projects (clone a popular website using React, image gallery with Vue, interactive contact form with either, PHP task manager with a DB, live comments)
---
* 76-100 : Advanced projects (e-commerce, blog with comments and tags, admin board, authentication with lost password handling)
